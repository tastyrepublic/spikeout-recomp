## How Spikeout multiplayer works on the arcade hardware

Each Spikeout cabinet is **one player**: one board, one joystick and four
buttons. Two to four players means two to four complete Model 3 boards,
linked through their network boards (mapped at `0xC0000000`). The game code
on each board exchanges state with the others every frame over that link.

So "four players on one PC" is not a mode the game has: it means running
four boards and a virtual link between them. See
[hardware-notes.md](hardware-notes.md#network-board-0xc0000000).

## Mode A: one board per player, link carried over the network

This is what Supermodel's `SimNetBoard` does: every PC runs one board, and
network board traffic is forwarded to the next cabinet in a ring over TCP.

- **Pros:** cheap (one board per PC); uses the game's own netcode; matches a
  known-working reference, so it's the right **first** milestone.
- **Cons:** the link expects cabinets on a local cable. Each frame waits for
  the neighbor's data, so it is effectively lockstep: fine on LAN or very low
  ping, stutters on ordinary internet connections.

## Mode B: rollback, every PC simulates all boards

Every PC runs **all** the linked boards (2–4) plus the virtual link inside
one process. Only controller inputs go over the network. Missing remote
inputs are predicted; when the real ones arrive and differ, every board is
restored to the last confirmed frame and re-simulated (GGPO style).

- **Pros:** responsive over the internet; spectators are easy (they receive
  confirmed inputs only); the same machinery gives local multiplayer on one
  PC (all inputs local, one window or split screen per player).
- **Cons:** N boards of CPU work per frame, more during rollback. Native
  recompiled code makes this realistic, and only the local player's board
  needs its graphics actually rendered — the others only need the Real3D
  state the CPU can observe.

### What Mode B needs from the runtime

1. **Determinism.** Same starting state + same inputs = bit-identical
   results on Windows, macOS and Linux, x86-64 and ARM64:
   - PowerPC floating point emulated exactly (rounding modes, `fres`/
     `frsqrte` estimates, fused vs. unfused multiply-add). Build with
     `-ffp-contract=off`, never fast-math.
   - No host time, thread scheduling or uninitialized memory reaching game
     state; the virtual link delivers data at fixed points in the frame.
   - Sound may run separately only if it never feeds back into the main CPU.
2. **Fast save/restore for N boards.** Per board: CPU registers
   (`ppc::CpuState`), 8 MB work RAM, backup and security RAM, Real3D/Tilegen
   memories, device registers, network board state. With 4 boards that's
   well over 32 MB, so saves must copy only dirty pages.
3. **Render separation.** Re-simulated frames are never drawn or heard.
4. **Desync detection.** Peers exchange a state hash every N frames.

## Session model (Mode B)

- 2–4 players plus spectators, peer-to-peer UDP with relay fallback.
  Candidate libraries: GekkoNet or GGPO (MIT); Steam Networking Sockets as an
  optional transport.
- ROM set CRCs and build version are compared at connect time; any
  difference guarantees a desync.

## Plan

1. Single board, single player (milestones 1–4).
2. Run two boards in one process with a virtual link → local 2-player.
   This proves the link emulation without any networking. **Done in
   `gamerun --boards N`** (2–4, `m3::LinkRing`; one thread per board,
   taking turns every `--slice` lines, the same every run). Still to do:
   the window frontend (one window or split screen per player, inputs per
   board).
3. Mode A over LAN, checked against Supermodel's link behavior.
4. Save states for all boards, determinism tests.
5. Mode B rollback online.
